    "### 1. Predicting a good day based on weather conditions to launch satellite: Precision is more important\n",
    "ðŸ”– Missing out to predict a good weather day is okay (low recall), but predicting the wrong weather day (false positive) to launch the satellite can be disastrous.\n",

    "### 2. Criminal death punishment: Precision is more important\n",
    "ðŸ”– Missing out to punish a criminal is okay (low recall), but incriminating an innocent person (false positive) is undesirable.\n",

    "### 3. Email spam detection: Precision is more important\n",
    "ðŸ”– Missing out to detect/classify a spam email is okay (low recall), but no legit or important email must go into the spam folder (false positive)."

    "ðŸ”– It is okay to classify a healthy person as having cancer (false positive) and following up with more medical tests, but it is definitely not okay to miss identifying a cancer patient or classifying a cancer patient as healthy (false negative) since the personâ€™s life is at stake.\n",

    "### 2. Not Safe For Work (NSFW) images detection: Recall is more important\n",
    "ðŸ”– It is okay to classify a valid image as NSFW (false positive) â€” it can always be rectified by manual data quality checks later. But it is definitely not okay to classify an NSFW image as a safe image (false negative) and displaying it on your companyâ€™s website since it will damage the companyâ€™s reputation.\n",

    "### 3. Flagging fraudulent transactions: Recall is more important\n",
    "ðŸ”– It is okay to classify a legit transaction as fraudulent â€” it can always be reverified by passing through additional checks. But it is definitely not okay to classify a fraudulent transaction as legit (false negative)."
